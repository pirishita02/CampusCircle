# ðŸš€ CampusCircle

**CampusCircle** is a peer-to-peer college community sharing platform built with **TypeScript (96%)**.  
The app empowers students to borrow, lend, or request items/services seamlessly within their campus radius.



## ðŸ“Œ Project Vision
CampusCircle is designed to be more than just a sharing app â€“ itâ€™s a **community ecosystem**.  
Students can:
- Borrow or lend essentials (books, notes, chargers, etc.).
- Share/rent short-term items (scooters, speakers, etc.).
- Get quick help in urgent situations (hygiene products, medicines, transport).
- Connect through social/wellness support groups.
